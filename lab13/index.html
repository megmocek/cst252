		<h1>Lab 13: Debugging</h1>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>In this lab, we had to use our Debugging skills to fix old labs. I already fixed my previous labs after analyzing them in class or asking Wes. I don't have
    any labs I need to fix, but I do have one lab I want to improve. After watching the lecture in class today, I learned some "if else" JS tips, so I would like
    to upgrade my Lab 11 to add even more options when the user types in their Zodiac Sign. So instead of only providing their element based on what Zodiac they type
    in, I would like to provide their Zodiac Sign based on their name.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>I did not come across any problems in this lab.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>The following includes the results of this lab.</p>

    <h5>Zodiac Element Generator</h5>
    <p>Type your first and last name to find out what zodiac element your sign falls under.</p>
    Please enter your NAME:
      <input type="text" id="input">
      <button id="button">Submit</button>
      <div id="output">
      </div>
