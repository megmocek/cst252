		<p>Hello! My name is Meg and I'm a Communications Design major with an emphasis in Visual Design. I spend a lot of time designing for the clothing
		brand I co-found with another student here at CSUMB, Mak. When I'm not doing homework, working, or designing for my brand I like to express my art skills
		using makeup. When I want to just relax and not make my mind work I really enjoy binge watching whatever TV show I am currently into. I have a cat named Gimli, who
		is named after the dwarf from Lord of the Rings because of his short legs, so I like to post pictures of him whenever I get the chance.</p>
