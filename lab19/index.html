		<h1>Lab 19: AJAX</h1>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>In this lab, we had to use AJAX to get information from an external source.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>This lab really confused me. I tried it by myself first and I was not sure if I did it right. I got the error to work but not the AJAX external source info.
		I checked the console andthe errors that popped up were not helpful since it had no errors, so I hope it kind of did what it was supposed to.
		I followed along in class with Wes andfor some reason my code did not work even though it looked the same, so I ended up using Wes' code from his Website and
		altering it a little. After attempting to change the website to something of my own I couldn't get it to work again, so I ended up sticking with Wes' code.
