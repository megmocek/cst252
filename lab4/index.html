		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>In this lab, we need to create an everyday task that most students may not know, and create a step by step list that shows how to complete that task.
		We then have to create a computer task that we might want to complete, and create a step by step list that shows how to complete that task. We then have to turn
		that pseudocode into comments on our .js file. We finish  the lab by completing our HTML for Lab 4; which includes wiriting our challenges/problems/results,
		writing a head with divs, adding our lists to
		our HTML file, adding any images, adding CSS, and uploading our file structure when it it working locally.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>The only difficulties I faced included: not being able to make the images work on the browser. I have contacted Wes about this issue so I am hoping to have this
		issue solved by next week.</p>
