	<p>My name is Meg and my partner's name is Torie. We both took CST 252 more 2-3 semesters ago, so Lab 2 is a good refresher for us. We are both hard working Graphic Design students who enjoy memes.
	We are currently both writing paragraphs about ourself, having an existential crisis because we can't find anything to write about ourselves.
	My goal with this class is to become better at designing websites because I have created a brand for my capstone and I would like to be able to make a website that sells the items I make.</p>
